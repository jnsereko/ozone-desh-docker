# Ozone - The Docker Compose Project

ðŸ‘‰ **Recommended:** Please refer to the [Ozone](https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-distro) repository to try and run Ozone ðŸ‘ˆ

While is not the recommended way, developpers can also run Ozone directly from this project. See instructions below.

## (option 1) Try Ozone FOSS in Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-docker)

It may take some time to setup Ozone for the first time, so hang tight :hourglass_flowing_sand:

When ready Gitpod will launch the tab for OpenMRS 3.

## (option 2) Try Ozone locally using the embedded Apache 2 proxy
