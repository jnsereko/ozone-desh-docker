# Ozone - The Docker Compose Project

ðŸ‘‰ **Recommended:** Please refer to the [Ozone](https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-distro) repository to try and run Ozone ðŸ‘ˆ

While is not the recommended way, developpers can also run Ozone directly from this project. See instructions below.

## (option 1) Try Ozone FOSS in Gitpod

## 1. Quick start

### Run Ozone FOSS locally
Type in the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnsereko/ozone-desh-docker
cd ozone-desh-docker
./start-demo.sh
```

It may take some time to download and setup Ozone for the first time, so hang tight :hourglass_flowing_sand:

Then [start browsing](#2-browse-ozone) Ozone.

#### :warning: Troubleshooting Ozone quick start locally?
If you experience issues with the quick start script? â†’ Try the [manual setup](readme/manual-setup.md) instead.

### Run Ozone FOSS in Gitpod
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-docker)

It may take some time to setup Ozone for the first time, so hang tight :hourglass_flowing_sand:

When ready Gitpod will launch the tab for OpenMRS 3.

## (option 2) Try Ozone locally using the embedded Apache 2 proxy
